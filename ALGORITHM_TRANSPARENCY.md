# Algorithm Transparency Documentation

## Overview

This document provides transparency regarding the algorithms and AI models used in the Beta AI Editor. We believe in open and transparent AI development, particularly when it comes to code generation tools that developers rely on for their work.

## Gemini AI Integration

### Model Information

- **Model Used**: `gemini-1.5-pro`
- **Provider**: Google AI (via Generative AI API)
- **Model Type**: Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Model Version**: As of April 2025

### How the Algorithm Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - User inputs a natural language prompt describing the code they want to generate
   - The prompt is combined with the selected programming language
   - A structured prompt template is created: `Generate ${selectedLanguage} code for: ${prompt}. Only provide the code, no explanations.`

2. **API Request**:
   - The structured prompt is sent to Google's Generative AI API
   - Authentication occurs using the provided API key
   - The request specifies the `gemini-1.5-pro` model

3. **Response Processing**:
   - The raw text response from the API is captured
   - No post-processing or filtering is applied to the generated code
   - The complete response is displayed to the user in the editor

4. **Error Handling**:
   - API errors are captured and displayed to the user
   - No automatic retry logic is implemented
   - Specific error messages are shown based on the type of error (API key issues, network problems, etc.)

### Algorithm Limitations

1. **Content Limitations**:
   - The code generation is limited by the training data of the Gemini model
   - The model may not be familiar with very recent programming languages or frameworks
   - Generated code is not guaranteed to be secure, efficient, or bug-free

2. **Bias Considerations**:
   - The model may reflect biases present in its training data
   - It may generate code that follows common patterns rather than optimal solutions
   - The model may favor certain programming paradigms over others

3. **Security Implications**:
   - Generated code should always be reviewed for security vulnerabilities
   - The model does not perform security analysis on the generated code
   - Users should not implement generated code in production without thorough review

## User Control and Agency

1. **Editing Capability**:
   - Users have full control to edit, modify, or discard generated code
   - The editor provides syntax highlighting to help users understand the generated code
   - Users can save, download, or clear the generated code at any time

2. **Prompt Refinement**:
   - Users can iteratively refine their prompts to get better results
   - There is no limit on the number of generation attempts
   - Users can specify details in their prompts to guide the generation process

3. **No Automatic Execution**:
   - Generated code is never automatically executed
   - Users must explicitly choose to use the generated code
   - The application does not have access to the user's broader development environment

## Data Usage and Privacy

1. **API Requests**:
   - User prompts are sent to Google's servers via the Generative AI API
   - Google's data usage policies apply to these requests
   - No user data is stored by the Beta AI Editor application itself

2. **Local Storage**:
   - Generated code can be saved locally by the user
   - No user data is transmitted to any servers other than the Gemini API
   - API keys are stored in environment variables and not transmitted elsewhere

## Continuous Improvement

We are committed to improving the transparency and performance of our AI integration:

1. **Model Updates**:
   - We regularly update to the latest stable versions of the Gemini API
   - Changes to the underlying model are documented in our release notes
   - Major algorithm changes will be reflected in updates to this document

2. **Feedback Incorporation**:
   - User feedback about algorithm performance is regularly reviewed
   - Patterns of generation issues are addressed through prompt engineering
   - Significant limitations are documented and communicated to users

## Conclusion

The Beta AI Editor strives to provide a useful code generation tool while maintaining transparency about how the underlying AI algorithms work. We encourage users to approach AI-generated code with appropriate caution and to leverage their own expertise when evaluating the output.
