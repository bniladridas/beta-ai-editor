# Troubleshooting Google Gemini API Integration: A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

Integrating AI capabilities into web applications has become increasingly popular, but it often comes with challenges, especially when working with evolving APIs like Google's Gemini. In this blog post, I'll share my experience troubleshooting and fixing a common error when integrating the Gemini API into a React application.

## The Problem

Our application, Beta AI Editor, is designed to generate code snippets based on user prompts using Google's Generative AI. However, we encountered this error:

```
Failed to generate code: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent: [404] models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1, or is not supported for generateContent.
```

This error occurred despite following the basic integration steps from Google's documentation.

## Understanding the Issue

The error message provides some important clues:
1. A 404 error indicates that the requested resource (the model) was not found
2. The specific model `gemini-pro` is either not available for the API version or not supported for the `generateContent` method

After investigation, we discovered two key issues:
1. The model name had changed in a recent API update
2. Our error handling wasn't robust enough to provide clear guidance to users

## The Solution

### 1. Updating the Model Name

Google periodically updates their AI models, and the model names can change. We updated our code from:

```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-pro' });
```

To:

```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-pro' });
```

This change reflects the current model naming convention in the Gemini API.

### 2. Improving Error Handling

We enhanced our error handling to provide more specific feedback:

```typescript
try {
  // API call code here
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error generating code:', err);
  if (err instanceof Error) {
    setError(`Failed to generate code: ${err.message}`);
  } else {
    setError('Failed to generate code. Please check your API key and try again.');
  }
}
```

### 3. Adding API Key Validation

We added a check to verify if the API key is available before making requests:

```typescript
// Check if API key is available
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY || '';
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey);

// Later in the code:
if (!apiKey) {
  setError('API key is missing. Please add your Gemini API key to the .env file.');
  return;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Stay Updated with API Documentation

AI APIs evolve rapidly. What worked yesterday might not work today. Regularly check the official documentation for updates on:
- Model names and versions
- API endpoints
- Required parameters
- Authentication methods

### 2. Implement Robust Error Handling

Detailed error handling is crucial when working with external APIs:
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle different types of errors appropriately (network issues, authentication problems, invalid parameters)

### 3. Use Environment Variables for API Keys

Never hardcode API keys in your application:
- Use environment variables to store sensitive information
- Include clear documentation on how to set up API keys
- Add validation to check if API keys are properly configured

### 4. Test with Different Scenarios

Test your API integration with various scenarios:
- Missing API key
- Invalid API key
- Network issues
- Different input parameters

## Implementation Details

Here's how we implemented the fix in our React application:

```typescript
// Initialize the API with proper validation
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY || '';
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey);

// In our component:
const generateCode = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!prompt.trim()) {
    setError('Please enter a prompt first');
    return;
  }

  // Check if API key is available
  if (!apiKey) {
    setError('API key is missing. Please add your Gemini API key to the .env file.');
    return;
  }

  setIsGenerating(true);
  setError('');

  try {
    // Use the correct model name
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-pro' });
    const promptText = `Generate ${selectedLanguage} code for: ${prompt}. Only provide the code, no explanations.`;

    const result = await model.generateContent(promptText);
    const response = await result.response;
    const generatedCode = await response.text();

    setCode(generatedCode);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error generating code:', err);
    if (err instanceof Error) {
      setError(`Failed to generate code: ${err.message}`);
    } else {
      setError('Failed to generate code. Please check your API key and try again.');
    }
  } finally {
    setIsGenerating(false);
  }
}, [prompt, selectedLanguage]);
```

## Conclusion

Integrating AI APIs like Google's Gemini can be challenging due to their evolving nature. By staying updated with documentation, implementing robust error handling, and following best practices for API key management, you can create more reliable AI-powered applications.

Remember that AI APIs are constantly improving, which means your integration code needs to be adaptable to changes. Regular testing and maintenance are essential to ensure your application continues to work as expected.
